# DocuPilot: AI-Powered Loan Processing System

DocuPilot is a comprehensive loan application processing system that leverages AI agents for document classification, field extraction, eligibility assessment, and automated decision-making.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Document Upload & Processing** (`loan_docu_pilot_app.py`)
   - Customer-facing Streamlit application
   - Document upload, classification, and field extraction
   - Loan application form with pre-filled data

2. **Loan Officer Dashboard** (`loan_officer_dashboard.py`)
   - Officer review interface
   - AI tools integration
   - Document verification and approval workflow
   - Comprehensive audit trail

3. **AI Agents**
   - **Eligibility Agent** (`agents/eligibility_agent/`) - Loan eligibility assessment
   - **Communication Agent** (`agents/communication_agent/`) - Customer notifications
   - **Verification Agent** (`agents/verification_agent/`) - Document authenticity checks
   - **Orchestration Service** (`agents/orchestration/`) - Pipeline coordination

4. **Data Layer**
   - Azure Cosmos DB for metadata and application state
   - Azure Blob Storage for document storage
   - Azure Cognitive Search for RAG-based document queries

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.10+
2. Azure services configured:
   - Cosmos DB
   - Blob Storage
   - Form Recognizer
   - OpenAI/Azure OpenAI
   - Cognitive Search

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create `.env` file with your Azure credentials:
   ```env
   # Azure Cosmos DB
   COSMOS_ENDPOINT=your_cosmos_endpoint
   COSMOS_KEY=your_cosmos_key
   
   # Azure Blob Storage
   AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=your_blob_connection_string
   
   # Azure Form Recognizer
   FORM_RECOGNIZER_ENDPOINT=your_form_recognizer_endpoint
   FORM_RECOGNIZER_KEY=your_form_recognizer_key
   
   # Azure OpenAI
   CHAT_ENDPOINT=your_openai_endpoint
   CHAT_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   EMBED_ENDPOINT=your_embed_endpoint
   EMBED_API_KEY=your_embed_key
   
   # Azure Cognitive Search
   SEARCH_ENDPOINT=your_search_endpoint
   SEARCH_API_KEY=your_search_key
   
   # Logic App for Email
   LOGIC_APP_URL=your_logic_app_url
   ```

### Running the System

1. **Start all backend services:**
   ```bash
   python start_services.py
   ```

2. **Start the customer application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run loan_docu_pilot_app.py
   ```

3. **Start the officer dashboard:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run loan_officer_dashboard.py --server.port 8501
   ```

## üìã End-to-End Workflow

### 1. Customer Journey
1. **Document Upload**: Customer uploads required documents (PAN, Passport, Bank Statement, ITR, Credit Report)
2. **Automatic Processing**: System classifies documents and extracts fields
3. **Loan Application**: Customer fills loan application with pre-populated data
4. **Submission**: Application enters processing pipeline

### 2. Automated Processing
1. **Classification**: AI classifies document types
2. **Extraction**: Azure Form Recognizer extracts structured data
3. **Validation**: System checks for completeness and required fields
4. **Eligibility Assessment**: AI evaluates loan eligibility with scoring
5. **Notification**: Customer receives status updates via email

### 3. Officer Review
1. **Dashboard Access**: Officers view applications by status
2. **Document Review**: Side-by-side view of documents and extracted data
3. **AI Tools**: Access to verification, compliance, and eligibility agents
4. **Decision Making**: Approve, reject, or request additional information
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all actions and decisions

## üß™ Testing

Run individual components:

```bash
# Test blob upload
python tests/test_blob_upload.py

# Test eligibility agent
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/check-eligibility" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"applicant_id": "test123"}'

# Test communication agent
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/send-notification" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"applicant_id": "test123", "customer_name": "Test User", "customer_email": "test@example.com", "eligibility_decision": {"decision": "Yes"}, "notification_type": "eligibility"}'
```

## üìà Scaling & Production

### Performance Considerations
- Use Azure Functions for document processing at scale
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
